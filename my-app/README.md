# React Portfolio About Me :)

Learning cool things with React! ðŸš€

This shows off my work in a portfolio.

## Description

This is a refactoring of an old portfolio website of mine using React. Formerly it was made from vanilla javascript, html and css. React is an in demand language to learn nowdays and this was great practice learning how to use React.

## Challenges

I understood conceptually what React is and does, and why it has a number of advantages but struggled with more complex concepts. I took me awhile how to write components and props correctly and understand how React works. I'm still learning about it currently.

Another problem is I keep changing my mind on how I would like the portfolio to look. I have one idea and it seems great, but then I have another idea that I change it to and I keep starting over.

Probably after the bootcamp I will go back and finish it up the way that I want it to finally look. 

## Next Steps

Project Three is coming up fast so I had to wrap up where I was on the React Portfolio to prepare for it. I needed to review class videos on NoSQL, GraphQL and React as well to brush up on concepts and remember things I started to forget.

Later on I want to make my portfolio resume ready and update the linked websites that I created.

I am also in the middle of moving to a different state so that is taking up a lot of time/energy as well. 

## Progress Update

I'm still deciding on the layout of the front-end and once I decide on something I'll update the components and try to finish up the site and deploy it. 

Have a great day!!! :)
