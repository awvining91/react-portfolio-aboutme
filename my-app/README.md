Learning cool things with React! ðŸš€

This shows off my work in a portfolio.

## Description

This is a refactoring of an old portfolio website of mine using React. Formerly it was made from vanilla javascript, html and css. React is an in demand language to learn nowdays and this was great practice learning how to use React.
